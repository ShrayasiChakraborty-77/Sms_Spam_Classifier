# Sms_Spam_Classifier
Sms_Spam_Classifier aims to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The model learns from a dataset of labeled emails and predicts whether a new message is spam, helping users filter out unwanted and harmful messages.
Key Features are Text preprocessing using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming),Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization,Model training using various ML algorithms:Na√Øve Bayes,Random Forest,SVC,Logistic Regression,Decision Tree. After testing these ML Algorithms,Naive Bayes provided the best balance between accuracy and precision. 
Final Accuracy : 97.87%
Precision : 100%
